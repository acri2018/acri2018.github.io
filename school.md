**School Program**

Cellular automata (CA) can be viewed as a mathematical abstraction of the physical world in which all quantities are of discrete nature. Due to its simplicity, CA turn out to a be very interesting approach to model complex systems in which a macroscopic collective behavior emerges out of the interaction of many simple elements. This school will indroduce this approach in a pedagogical way through many examples illustrating the essence of CA modeling.
The program is the following:

- Introduction: What are CAâ€™s?: computational model, discrete dynamical system, abstraction of physical and natural systems
- Definition: Parity rule. Neighborhood, stochastic CA, non-uniform CA, asymchronous CA. Implementation: lookup table, on the fly computation. Number of possible universe
- Historical notes: from von-Neuman to Langton self-reproduction CA
- Modeling of physical system: create a fititious world where conservation laws and symmetries are preserved. <br>Examples: snowflakes, excitable media,... 
<br>traffic models, lezard, homostatis,...
- Understanding complex systems through CAs: life, Langton ants, Wol- fram complexity classes...
- Lattice gases: CA fluids, diffusion models, exact computation and re- versibility
- Extension: lattice Boltzmann, multi-agent: in-silico modeling at a mesoscopic level.
- Exercises: will be inserted during the presentation

***Additional Information***: For PhD students from the University of Milano-Bicocca the school is valid for one course credit.

The school will continue with the [workshops](/workshops) to introduce the students to recent research results on various aspects of CA.

	Bastien Chopard is full professor at the University of Geneva, and group leader in the Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics. He earned his PhD in theoretical physics from the University of Geneva in 1988. He then spent two years as a postdoc in the laboratory for computer science at MIT (Cambridge, USA), and one year in the Research Center, Juelich (Germany) before joining the computer science department at University of Geneva. His main research interests is the modeling and simulation of complex systems. He is internationally recognized for his work on Cellular Automata and Lattice Boltzmann methods. He wrote more than 200 scientific articles, presenting interdisciplinary research in various fields, such as physics, social and environmental science, bio-medical applications, numerical and optimization methods, parallel computing and multiscale modeling.
