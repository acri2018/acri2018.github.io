**School Program**

Cellular automata (CA) can be viewed as a mathematical abstraction of the physical world in which all quantities are of discrete nature. Due to its simplicity, CA turn out to a be very interesting approach to model complex systems in which a macroscopic collective behavior emerges out of the interaction of many simple elements. This school will indroduce this approach in a pedagogical way through many examples illustrating the essence of CA modeling.
The program is the following:

- Introduction: What are CAâ€™s?: computational model, discrete dynamical system, abstraction of physical and natural systems
- Definition: Parity rule. Neighborhood, stochastic CA, non-uniform CA, asymchronous CA. Implementation: lookup table, on the fly computation. Number of possible universe
- Historical notes: from von-Neuman to Langton self-reproduction CA
- Modeling of physical system: create a fititious world where conservation laws and symmetries are preserved. <br>Examples: snowflakes, excitable media,... 
<br>traffic models, lezard, homostatis,...
- Understanding complex systems through CAs: life, Langton ants, Wol- fram complexity classes...
- Lattice gases: CA fluids, diffusion models, exact computation and re- versibility
- Extension: lattice Boltzmann, multi-agent: in-silico modeling at a meso- scopic level.
- Exercises: will be inserted during the presentation

***Additional Information***: For PhD students from the University of Milano-Bicocca the school is valid for one course credit.
