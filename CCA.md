title: Crowds and Cellular Automata
---

**International Joint Workshop on Crowds and Cellular Automata**

Pedestrian and crowd simulation is a consolidated research and application context, in which results that lead to technology transfer (off-the-shelf available commercial tools are daily used by designers and planners) co-exist with open challenges for researchers in different fields and disciplines, to improve model expressiveness (i.e. simplifying the modeling activity or introducing the possibility of representing phenomena that were still not considered) and efficiency of the simulators based on those approaches. Cellular Automata (CA) and discrete modeling approaches represent a well-known research trend within this context, able to produce robust results but also to define innovative lines of work, also influencing different modeling approaches.

Following the line defined by its previous editions (one joint with the Traffic and Cellular Automata workshop, also present within ACRI 2018 as a separate event), the goal of the C&CA 2018 workshop is to bring together difference competencies, contributions and practical experiences related to pedestrian and crowd modeling with CA and discrete modeling approaches. Innovative modeling efforts trying to represent pedestrian and crowd dynamics, applications and practical experiences, 

Topics of the workshop include, but are not limited to the following:
- pedestrian behaviour
- crowd dynamics
- applications to design and planning
- empirical results, experiments, data collection and analysis
- calibration and validation
- multi-scale, hybrid models and approaches

**Submissions and Publication**

Authors are invited to submit papers complying with the Springer-Verlag format and the maximum length of 10 pages. Formatting style files and further guidelines can be found in the relevant ACRI 2018 site page. Submissions should be performed via easychair [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cca20180](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=cca20180).

Accepted papers will be published by Springer-Verlag in a volume of the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series in a section of the ACRI 2018 proceedings. This volume will be available by the time of the workshop. We plan to publish a selection of revised and extended papers presented during the workshop in a special issue of a relevant international journal.
