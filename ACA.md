**Fifth International Workshop on Asynchronous Cellular Automata and Asynchronous Discrete Models**


Cellular Automata are a well-known formal tool for modeling complex systems; they are found in many scientific fields and industrial applications. Synchronicity is one of the main features of Cellular Automata evolutions. Indeed, in the most common Cellular Automata framework, all cells are updated simultaneously at each discrete time step.

Recent trends consider the modeling of asynchronous systems based on local interactions. The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers dealing with the theme of the asyncronicity inside Cellular Automata and other Discrete Models such as discrete Multi-Agents Systems, Boolean Networks, and so on, in order to foster their interaction and to provide a forum for presenting new ideas and works in progress on the subject. The subject of Probabilistic Cellular Automata and Probabilistic Discrete Models is also included among the themes of ACA 2018.

Topics include, but are not limited to the following aspects of Asynchronous Cellular Automata and Asynchronous Discrete Models (such as Multi-Agents Systems, Boolean Networks and so on):

- dynamics of asynchronous/probabilistic systems
- complexity issues
- computational issues
- emergent properties
- models of parallelism and distributed systems
- models of phenomena from biology, chemistry, physics, engineering and other fields
- applications of  asynchronous and probabilistic automata (genetic regulation networks, network coding, load balancing, etc)

Both theoretical and applicative contributions are welcome.

**Submissions and Publications**

Authors are invited to submit papers according to two contribution categories -- full and short papers -- meant to provide a differentiation of the papers in terms of their length, depth and/or maturity. Papers must comply with the Springer-Verlag format and the maximum length of 5 and 10 pages for short and full contributions, respectively.
Paper submissions should be performed via easychair [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aca20181](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=aca20181).

Accepted papers will be published by Springer-Verlag in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series.

**Journal Special Issue**

It is also planned that selected papers will be considered for publication in Special Issues of an international journal (Natural Computing).
They will contain refereed extended versions of selected papers presented at the ACA workshop.
