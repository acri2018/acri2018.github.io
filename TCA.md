**5th Workshop on TCA - Traffic and Cellular Automata**

Cellular Automata are powerful tools for modeling complex systems used 
in various research fields. One of the growing topics for the last few 
decades is traffic modeling, which includes vehicular traffic on highway 
networks, city traffic with signal control and public conveyance. 
The investigation of such systems is important for both practical and 
scientific reasons. Reducing traffic congestion contributes to economic 
efficiency and modeling of traffic flow allows for new insights into 
nonequilibrium systems of self-driven particles.
The aim of this workshop is to bring together interdisciplinary 
researchers studying traffic-related topics, and discuss methods 
for modeling, analysis and practical applications. Topics of either 
theoretical or applied interest include, but are not limited to the following:

- traffic modeling (highway and urban traffic, public transport etc.)
- analytical methods
- computer simulations
- empirical results, experiments and data analysis (machine learning etc.)
- traffic control
- engineering applications
- traffic networks
- related systems (biological transport, granular flow etc.)
