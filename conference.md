Since its first edition in 1994, the ACRI conference focused on challenging problems and new research on Cellular Automata (CA). Its primary goal is to offer both scientists and engineers in academies and industries an opportunity to enforce international collaborations on Cellular Automata and express  their views on current trends, challenges, and state-of-the art solutions to various problems in several scientific fields: biology, computer science, chemistry, ecology, economy, engineering, geology, medicine, physics, sociology, etc.

The main conference will take place from September 19 to September 21, 2018. It will be preceeded by one day of [workshops](/workshops/) an the First [Intensive School on Cellular Automata](/school/).

As a cellular automaton, a BIO-LGCA is defined on a regular lattice, where the nodes of the lattice take a certain number of discrete states. As a lattice-gas, the state space of a BIO-LGCA is related to the lattice geometry. Each node can be occupied by ``biological agents'', e.g. biological cells, characterised by their velocities which are restricted to the unit vectors connecting a node to its nearest neighbors. Agents move along the links and interact on the nodes of the lattice. This interaction can change the number of agents at individual nodes (birth/death processes) and may depend on the states in neighbouring nodes which allows to model collective effects. Meanwhile, the BIO-LGCA has been established as discrete lattice- and agent-based model which permits multi-scale analysis and efficient large-simulations. We provide BIO-LGCA model examples for single and collective cell migration as well as problems motivated by cancer invasion. <br>
