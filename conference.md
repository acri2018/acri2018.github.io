Since its first edition in 1994, the ACRI conference focused on challenging problems and new research on Cellular Automata (CA). Its primary goal is to offer both scientists and engineers in academies and industries an opportunity to enforce international collaborations on Cellular Automata and express  their views on current trends, challenges, and state-of-the art solutions to various problems in several scientific fields: biology, computer science, chemistry, ecology, economy, engineering, geology, medicine, physics, sociology, etc.

The main conference will take place from September 19 to September 21, 2018. It will be preceeded by one day of [workshops](/workshops/) an the First [Intensive School on Cellular Automata](/school/).
